This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instructions on how to setup and serve the webpage

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Instructions on navigating about the webpage

Click on a crypto to see an expanded view.

## A note on requirements versus implementation

I did not implement a specialized page for each crypto currency. I also did not include icons for each cryptocurrency.

Instead, I prioritized two other features: expandable cards, and a bubble chart. My goal was to deliver the best user experience possible, within the time that I had.   

I made a judgement call that, for my design, these two features would do a better job of allowing users to 
```
1) consume an overview of the most popular crypto assets and 2) drill into a specific crypto asset in order to see a more detailed visualization of its information.
```
 

## TODOs

If I were to continue working on this repo, some things I would do include:

1. Use locally scoped style
2. Improve error handling (for example, while fetching data)
3. Refactor components a bit for reusability/extensibility
4. Make the page responsive, and mobile friendly
